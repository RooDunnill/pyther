        This project is designed around the idea of crytography and pentesting. I really want to learn some of the more hands on aspects of 
        cryptography and cybersecurity, and so have made this website. It currently is or is planned to be ran on one of my raspberry pi 3s,
        which i can then host permanently. I then plan to use another one of my pis, to try to crash the website or crack the encryption on
        here to learn more about the eavesdropping/penetration testing side of cryptography.
